  <h1>My Favorite Olympic Figure Skaters: Women</h1>

  <p>
    Women’s singles is one of the most exciting disciplines to watch because it has such a deep field; even the smallest mistake can send you plummeting down the rankings.
  </p>

  <p>
    My favorite skaters are the ones who balance technical difficulty with performance quality. I enjoy these skaters in particular for 
    their powerful, emotional performances.
  </p>

  <p>
    The skaters below stand out to me because of their consistency under pressure, signature elements,
    and distinctive skating styles that make their programs memorable. It's also worth noting that the three-skater maximum per country for 
    any given international event means that there are always so many more qualified skaters than there are spots. The pressure during an Olympic
    year, in particular, is <span class="highlight">absolutely insane</span>. Regardless of their Olympic placment, I have so much respect for all of the skaters for being able to withstand
    that pressure.
